To test the following three hypotheses:
- User activity depends on the day of the week, and this is manifested differently in Moscow and St. Petersburg.
- On Monday morning, different genres predominate in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Similarly, on Friday evening, different genres prevail depending on the city.
- Moscow and St. Petersburg prefer different music genres. Pop music is more often listened to in Moscow, while Russian rap is more popular in St. Petersburg.
Research Process

## Study stages:

- Hypothesis testing.

## Summary of the Analysis Results

- The first hypothesis was fully confirmed: the day of the week affects user activity differently in Moscow and St. Petersburg.
- The second hypothesis was partially confirmed: musical preferences do not change significantly throughout the week, whether in Moscow or St. Petersburg. Small differences are noticeable only on Mondays: in Moscow users listen to the "world", while in St. Petersburg - to jazz and classical music.
- The third hypothesis was not confirmed: the musical tastes of users in Moscow and St. Petersburg have more similarities than differences.
