## Summary of the Analysis Results

Based on the data analysis:

- The leaders in terms of the number of establishments in Moscow are cafes and restaurants, with canteens and bakeries being the least represented.
- Bars/pubs and restaurants have the highest average number of seats, while cafes have the lowest.
- The average rating of establishments is almost independent of their category.
- Non-chain establishments outnumber chain establishments by about one-third.
- Chain establishments are more frequently represented by bakeries, pizzerias, and coffee shops, while non-chain establishments dominate the other categories.
- The most popular chains in Moscow are large nationwide networks (the top 3 are "Shokoladnitsa", "Domino's Pizza", and "Dodo Pizza").
- The Central District leads by a significant margin in the number of establishments of all categories.
- The Central District is also the leader in average ratings of establishments, their quantity, average check, as well as the median price of coffee and beer.
- The largest number of establishments is located on the main streets; four out of the top five positions in this indicator are held by avenues - Mira, Vernadsky, Leninsky, and Leningradsky.
- The smallest number of establishments is found in the center in alleyways and small streets or on the periphery.
- The most promising districts for opening a new coffee shop are the Western and Southwestern Administrative Districts, as they have an average or low number of establishments in this category. Both districts feature the highest prices for a cup of cappuccino, meaning that slightly lowering the price could provide a significant competitive advantage. Moreover, both districts have few establishments with the highest ratings.
