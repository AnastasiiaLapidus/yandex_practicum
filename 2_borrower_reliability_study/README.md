# Research on Borrower Reliability
The research is commissioned by the bank's credit department. The goal of the study is to determine whether marital status and the number of children of a client influence their ability to repay a loan on time. The input data provided by the bank includes statistics on the creditworthiness of clients. (The results of the research will be taken into account when developing a credit scoring model, a special system that evaluates the potential borrower's ability to repay a loan to the bank.)

## Research Objective

Determining risk factors for borrowers' default on loan repayment within the established term.

## Study stages:

- Assess the suitability of the initial data for further analysis and conduct data preprocessing.
- Perform data categorization.
- Determine the presence of a correlation between loan default and other client characteristics.
- Formulate risk factors for borrowers' default on loan repayment within the established term.

## Summary of the Analysis Results

Based on the categorical data analysis, it can be concluded that the additional risk factors for defaulting on a loan within the specified period are:

- Having children;
- Belonging to categories "single" (не женат/не замужем), "in a civil marriage" (состоит в гражданском браке);
- Stating "car-related operations" or "education expenses" as the purpose of the loan;
- Annual income level in the range of 50001–200000.
